# ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer – Smart Time Management Tool

**A practical, visual timer  designed to help you manage your time and focus using the Pomodoro technique.**

This project lets you build your own chain of timers—like 30 minutes for deep focus, followed by a 5-minute break, then another session—and so on. Each timer flows automatically into the next with helpful visual cues to keep you on track.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔁 **Chained Timers**  
  Create multiple timers that run in sequence (e.g. 30 min Focus → 5 min Break → 30 min → 5 min, etc.).

- ➕ **Custom Time Blocks**  
  Add your own focus sessions, short breaks, long breaks, or any other timing combinations.

- 🖼️ **Visual Transitions**  
  The interface updates with colors or visuals to reflect the current timer phase.

- 🔔 **Automatic Flow**  
  No need to start each timer manually—once one ends, the next begins automatically.

- 🎯 **Productivity-Oriented Design**  
  The layout and visuals help maintain your attention and provide feedback at a glance.
